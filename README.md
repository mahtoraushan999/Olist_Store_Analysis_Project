# Olist_Store_Analysis_Project
An Olist Store analysis project using SQL typically involves analyzing a comprehensive e-commerce dataset from Olist, a Brazilian online marketplace. The project's core objective is to extract meaningful insights from the data using SQL queries to understand various aspects of the business, such as customer behavior, order trends, product performance, and delivery efficiency.

**Key aspects and analyses in such a project include:**

**Data Exploration and Understanding:**
> Familiarizing with the multiple tables in the Olist dataset (e.g., **orders**, **customers**, **products**, **sellers**, **order_items**, **payments**, **reviews**, **geolocation** ).

> Understanding the relationships between tables and identifying primary and foreign keys for joining.

**Customer Analysis:**
> Identifying top customers by order count or total spending.

> Analyzing customer demographics and geographical distribution.

> Segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior.
