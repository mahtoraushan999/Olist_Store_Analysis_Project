# Olist_Store_Analysis_Project
An Olist Store analysis project using SQL typically involves analyzing a comprehensive e-commerce dataset from Olist, a Brazilian online marketplace. The project's core objective is to extract meaningful insights from the data using SQL queries to understand various aspects of the business, such as customer behavior, order trends, product performance, and delivery efficiency.

**Key aspects and analyses in such a project include:**

**Data Exploration and Understanding:**
> Familiarizing with the multiple tables in the Olist dataset (e.g., **orders**, **customers**, **products**, **sellers**, **order_items**, **payments**, **reviews**, **geolocation**).

> Understanding the relationships between tables and identifying primary and foreign keys for joining.

**Customer Analysis:**
> Identifying top customers by order count or total spending.

> Analyzing customer demographics and geographical distribution.

> Segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior.

**Order and Sales Analysis:**
> Calculating total sales, average order value, and order frequency over time.

> Identifying peak sales periods and trends.

> Analyzing order status distribution (e.g., delivered, canceled, shipped).

**Product and Seller Performance:**
> Determining best-selling products and categories.

> Analyzing product review scores and identifying areas for improvement.

> Evaluating seller performance based on sales volume, delivery times, and customer reviews.

**Payment and Shipping Analysis:**
> Analyzing preferred payment methods and their distribution.

> Investigating shipping performance, including delivery times and potential delays.

> Analyzing freight costs and their impact on profitability.

**Advanced Analysis (Optional):**
> Correlation analysis between variables like shipping time and review scores.

> Geographical analysis of orders and customer locations.
